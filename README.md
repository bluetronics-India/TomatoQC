# TomatoQC
A concept application for visual inspection of vegetables(tomatoes)  using Machine Learning via the DLib machine learning toolkit.

This code repository is part of this blog post that examines the possibility of using the Dlib's object detection and recognition
capabalities to scan tomatoes for performing automated visual inspection of their quality.

## Prerequisites

This code is tested on Ubntu 16.4 system with Python 3. Following are the list of external python package dependencies required for running the demo code.

1. Anaconda3
2. Dlib
3. OpenCV (Python bindings)

Prior knowledge of working with Dlib and it's Imglib tool will be helpful. 
For more details on building and using ImgLab, refer to this [Github link](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/tree/master/tools/imglab)
